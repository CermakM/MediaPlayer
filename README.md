# A Simple Music Player GUI

## Developed in Qt

### The music player is suitable for grouping your songs and adding them to the library. 

### Version Notes: 

#### A user-friendly interface (like drag & dropping) has not been implemented yet
#### Has not been tested (and probably won't work yet) for other then .mp3 songs

##### Feel free to customize the player to your needs
